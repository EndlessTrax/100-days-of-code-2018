Write a script election.py that will simulate an election between two candidates,
A and B. One of the candidates wins the overall election by a majority based on the
outcomes of three regional elections. (In other words, a candidate wins the overall
election by winning at least two regional elections.) Candidate A has the following
odds:
87% chance of winning region 1
65% chance of winning region 2
17% chance of winning region 3
Import and use the random() function from the random module to simulate events
based on probabilities; this function doesn't take any arguments (meaning you
don't pass it any input variables) and returns a random value somewhere between
0 and 1.
Simulate 10,000 such elections, then (based on the average results) display the
probability that Candidate A will win and the probability that Candidate B will win.
Hint: To do this, you'll probably need to use a for loop with a lot of if / else
statements to check the results of each regional election.
