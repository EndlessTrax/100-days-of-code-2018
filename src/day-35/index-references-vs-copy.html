    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    /// const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
