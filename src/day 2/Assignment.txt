Define a function, enrollment_stats() , that takes, as an input, a list of lists where
each individual list contains three elements: (a) the name of a university, (b) the
total number of enrolled students, and (c) the annual tuition fees.
Sample list:
universities = [
['California Institute of Technology', 2175, 37704],
['Harvard', 19627, 39849],
['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 10566, 40732],
['Princeton', 7802, 37000],
['Rice', 5879, 35551],
['Stanford', 19535, 40569],
['Yale', 11701, 40500]
]
This function should return two lists: the first containing all of the student enrollment
values and the second containing all of the tuition fees.
Next, define a mean() and a median() function. Both functions should take a
single list as an argument and return the mean and median from the values in each
list. Use the return values from enrollment_stats() as arguments for each
function. Challenge yourself by finding a way to sum all the values in a list
without using the built-in 'sum()' function for calculating the mean.
At some point you should calculate the total students enrolled and the total tuition
paid.
Finally, output all values:
*************************
Total students: 77285
Total tuition: $ 271905
Student mean: 11040
Student median: 10566
Tuition mean: $ 38843
