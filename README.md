# My 100 days of code challenge 2018

## Why?

Because I need some structure! My life is hectic, at best. So I need social accountability (otherwise known as positive peer-pressure) to get shit done sometimes. It's how I wrote my first book!

This will also help me take steps to build my portfolio, friends, and confidence as I aim for the next level in my career as a developer.

## The *(modified)* rules

I vow to code for a total of **one** hour per day. This will be done in one or more sessions.

This coding time will be used to build portfolio and personal projects, and *not* client work. It may include tutorials that involve following along while coding. *Just* watching the videos doesn't count. Writing pseudo code does count.

Writing coding tutorials for my blog may count towards the total time, but can not make up more than half of the total time spent (30 minutes max).

On travel days I will miss no more than two full days. Any days missed will be added onto the end of the challenge until 100 coding days has been reached.

Acceptable reasons for missing a day:

- Travelling on plane/train/car over distance
- Nursing sick children
- Loss of limbs / or serious hand injury.
- Death

Code is to be pushed to Github or Bitbucket (for private repos) daily. Not all code will be in this repo. Projects may require their own repo, in which case the links to those will be placed in the section below.

## Possible builds

Update [Zon-Top-100](https://github.com/EndlessTrax/Zon-Top-100) *(damn Amazon changing their website!)*

Update [Flask_template_GUI](https://github.com/EndlessTrax/Flask_template_GUI)

Build a Quiz app

**Started** - Build a CRUD web app with a list of Movies I'd like to watch. Bonus points for integrating with Omdb API.

Build a Bonsai Catalog web app (maybe with django and Twilio?)

Build a secret project... shushhhh!

Contribute to an open source project.

And probably more.... maybe...

## Stuff I want to learn

In no particular order:

- Lots more Python
- Basic Data Analysis (Pandas, Numpy)
- Django
- SCSS
- SSH
- Bash
- SQL (and database practice in general)
- Docker
- Google Home Action w/ Python
